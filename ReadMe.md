## iPhone Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the price drop of iPhones over a period of time by using the Linear Regression machine learning model. The dataset used in this project was manually created and includes features such as Launched Year, Initial Price, Current Price, and iPhone Age.

The project involved the creation of three components: the backend, the frontend, and model training. The backend was developed using Flask, which is a Python-based web framework, to handle the requests and responses between the frontend and the model. The frontend was developed using Angular, which is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework.

For model training, the Linear Regression algorithm was implemented to train the model using the manually created dataset. The trained model is used to make predictions about the price drop of iPhones over a period of time.
